          <h2>Chiropractic can help with these issues</h2>
          <h3>Headaches and Migraine</h3>
          Malfunctioning joints in your neck can become sore and inflammed,
          irritating the nerves around that joint , and are associated with
          reflexive muscle tightness. Often pain starts at the base of the skull
          and radiates into the temples, eyeballs, and forehead.
          <br />
          Chiropractic adjustment can help restore normal movement to the
          vertebrae in your neck, eliminating the cause of your headaches rather
          than offering a temporary relief from the symptoms.

          <h3>Whiplash</h3>
          <p>
            Whiplash is a common injury for people involved in car collisions,
            falls and other violent head movements.

            <br />
            When a car is struck from behind or collides with another object, it
            causes the neck to snap back and forth violently. This causes muscle
            and ligaments strains and/or tears, which can cause stiffness and
            soreness.

            <br />
            Whiplash can also cause structural damage such as misaligned
            vertebrae, herniated, bulging or ruptured discs, or nerve damage.
            Left untreated this can cause ongoing pain, degeneration and
            osteoarthritis.
          </p>
          <h3>Neck/Back Pain</h3>
          <p>
            Neck & back pain is often caused by subluxations, or misalignments
            of your vertebrae. A small misalignment can cause pain due to
            irritated/inflammed joint cartilage and nerves. These subluxations
            also involve muscle spasms and chronic muscle imbalances increasing
            pain. Chiropractic adjustments properly align your spine so that
            pressure on joints and nerves is released and pain diminishes.
            Anti-inflammatory drugs provide a temporary relief but can have
            serious side effects.
          </p>
          <h3>Sciatica</h3>

          <p>
            When the sciatic nerve is irritated it can cause severe pain,
            weakness, numbness and/or pins & needles down the leg right to the
            foot.
            <br />
            One common form of joint dysfunction is sacroiliac joint
            dysfunction, which occurs where the base of the spine meets the
            pelvis. It causes low back pain and prohibits movement. This
            condition is often misdiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to
            sciatica or a herniated disc.
            <br />
            Sciatica is a condition that results when the sciatic nerve becomes
            irritated. Bulging discs, spinal subluxations, and muscle spasms can
            all cause increased pressure on the sciatic nerve. When this happens
            it causes pain, numbness, and weakness in the lower back and leg. To
            properly treat sciatica the cause of the condition needs to be
            diagnosed and properly treated. Your chiropractor can help you do
            this.

          <p class="lead">
            Applied Kinesiologyâ„¢ is a diagnostic system that uses muscle testing
            as a tool to assess your nervous system function, which monitors and
            coordinates all your body interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applied Kinesiology does not replace standard orthopaedic and
            neurological examinations. It is used in conjunction with a
            comprehensive patient history and other recognised standard forms of
            assessment and examination.
            <br />
            In general, the applied kinesiologist finds a muscle that tests weak
            and then determines why that muscle is not functioning properly .
            The practitioner will then evaluate and apply the therapy that will
            best eliminate the muscle weakness and help the patient.
            <br />
            Therapies utilized can include specific joint manipulation or
            mobilization, various myofascial therapies, cranial techniques,
            meridian therapy, clinical nutrition, dietary management and various
            reflex procedures.

          <h2>Spinal Adjustments</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Adjustments are subtle movements of vertebrae to help them regain
            normal range of motion and function better.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is done with the purpose of restoring normal nerve function and
            to reduce the mechanical stress on the spine. The effect allows the
            patient to feel and function better.
            <br />
            Adjustments are safe and can be done on people of all ages. Infants
            get adjusted after birth, elderly commonly get adjusted to stay
            well, and most certainly everyone in between benefits by keeping
            their spine healthy.
            <br />
            Adjustments are only done to those areas of the spine that need
            help. Because the spine improves from the adjustment, people
            commonly report pleasure from being adjusted. The experience is one
            of improved well being.
            <br />

            Adjustments are an excellent way to keep the body functioning well.
            <br />

            When the spine is in alignment it is able to respond and perform as
            it was designed to.
